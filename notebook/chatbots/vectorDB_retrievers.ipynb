    "\n",
    "This video tutorial will familiarize you with langchain's vector store and retriever abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data-- from (vector) databases and other sources -- for intergration with llm workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation.\n",
